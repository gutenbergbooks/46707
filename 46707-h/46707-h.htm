<h2>HOW A KINEMATOGRAPH PICTURE
IS PRODUCED</h2>


<p>1 <span class="smcap">The Audience.</span> This is often deaf, and as often
wishes it were. It pays large money for uncomfortable
seats, smoke-laden atmosphere, and peppermint scenery.
It also pays an entertainment tax, and wonders why it
is so called. The front seats applaud the dashing hero,
and are surprised at his coldness, forgetting that he
can’t hear, oh!</p>

<p>2 <span class="smcap">The Names of the Players.</span> These are perhaps
more important than the audience, and involve the
expenditure of much fine gold to determine whether
Artie Applin is Artie Applin’s name or a pseudonymous
inexactitude appropriated to the corporation financing
the undertaking. The answer is in the negative, usually.</p>

<p>3 <span class="smcap">The Palace.</span> Of this there are two kinds. First,
the disused theatre, known as <span class="smcap">De Luxe</span>, on the <i>lucus
a non lucendo</i> principle, it being steeped in quintessence
of Cimmerian gloom and warmed by diminutive red
lights marked Exit. The other kind is the disused
barn, known as the <span class="smcap">Gem</span>; of which the brilliance is all
outside, and the inside reminds one of the apocalyptic
sardine stone.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/i_008.jpg" width="313" height="471" alt="man falling off cliff but catching vine" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>The villain must not get caught too soon.</i></p></div>
</div>
<p>4 <span class="smcap">The Machine and Operator.</span> These are two hands
with but a single handle, which is turned, but which
does not produce the music above referred to. The
Operator is a skilled labourer. His work consists in
lighting the lamp, fixing the film, and turning the
handle. This last is very difficult to perform properly:
for not only does the operator have to keep time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the music above
referred to, but he
must be most careful
that the villain
does not get
caught before his
pursuers arrive,
and that none of
the characters escape
from the
screen.</p>



<p>5 <span class="smcap">The Film.</span>
Everyone knows
what a film is and
how the photographs
are taken,
so it is unnecessary
to say anything
on this
point. It may not,
however, be generally
known that
all films are transparent
in varying
degrees, and that
the picture which
appears on the
screen is caused
by the light from
the lantern passing
through, or being obstructed by, the film. That
which is dark on the film thus becomes dark on
the screen, and that which is light on the screen is
represented by that which is light on the film. This
throws a great deal of light on things otherwise dark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The apparent movement of the players is produced
by the turning of the before-mentioned handle.</p>

<p>6 <span class="smcap">The Leading Lady’s Smile.</span> This elusive abstraction
is part of the stock-in-trade of the management.
Its cost to the lady is merely the trouble to contract
certain risible muscles, but the contract itself is more
precious than rubies. The rippling smile of golden
corn is as nothing to the golden smile of a rippling
actress. It cuts ice. It are the goods. It is <small>IT</small> some.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY ESSAY</h2>

<div class='blockquot'>ON THE INTELLECTUAL, MORAL, AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL VALUE OF THE
KINEMATOGRAPH AS AN EFFECTIVE AID
TO THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN;</div>

<div class='center'><small>OR,</small><br />

WHAT’S THE GOOD OF IT?</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have no sympathy with those who maintain
that the merely visual presentment of presentations as
presently presented conveys a more lasting impression
to a child’s mind than the same thing expressed in
more technical treatment. It is as easy, we hold, to
teach a child his Multiplication Table by <i>saying</i>
“Twice two are four” as by <i>writing</i> this questionable
statement on a black-board or white sheet.</p>

<p>But we venture to assert, and are prepared to uphold
with all the strength and vigour of our arms—being
thereto in duty bound by the nature of our obligations
as members of a civilized community striving incessantly
to banish from the four corners of the earth
those outrageous transgressions against<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>—where were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
we?—oh, yes. We say that it <i>is</i> easier to teach a
child by means of short pithy sentences than by
long—winded and involved dittoes. Which would a
child—which would you—rather learn, and which
would you find easier: the whole of “Paradise Lost,”
or the following Kinematic summary:—</p>


<ul class='list'><li>1. Garden of Eden.</li>
<li>2. Eve steals apple.</li>
<li>3. Adam shares.</li>
<li>4. Both expelled from Garden.</li></ul>



<p>It has been thought by many eminent scholastic
and preceptual authorities that this is (1) a good
summary; (2) theologically sound; (3) simple;
(4) expressed with some quantity of jerk. And it
has been further pointed out that another of its hidden
merits is the ease with which it can be explained.
Not a word in it but will be quite familiar to the
youngest scholar: with two possible exceptions.
“Expelled” (which means “driven out”) might be
unfamiliar to a child of two; and “Apple” (at 9<i>d.</i> a lb.)
might be a forbidden fruit to a child of one or one and
a half.</p>

<p>Q.E.D., therefore. We may regard it as proven that
the Kinematograph has come to stay. <i>Hinc illae
lacrimae</i>: because, after all, it destroys eyesight and
thus defeats its own purposes; for a blind person
attending a Kinematograph performance must be a
<i>real</i> enthusiast.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN’S HOUR</h2>


<h3>HUMPTY DUMPTY</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">The</span> building of the Wall. A strike. A settlement.</p>

<p>2 Humpty Dumpty arrives, and after several ineffectual
attempts to climb, rolls up to the top, where
he seats himself.</p>

<p>3 A gust of wind blows him off, dislodging one
brick. He falls. He breaks.</p>

<p>4 He pulls himself together. He has some pull.</p>

<p>5 He applies for summons against Balbus, builder of
the wall, for contributory negligence. To which
Balbus replies with a cross-summons for trespass and
nuisance.</p>

<p>6 Humpty Dumpty is asked his age. 23. Nuisance
held to be proved. Nasal organs likewise held. Judge
willing to grant injunction, but thinks con-junction
would be more useful after such a dis-junction.</p>

<p>7 King’s Proctor intervenes with statement of Royal
interest in plaintiff. Very old friend of family. Elicited
that squadron of cavalry had been sent out to assist.</p>

<p>8 Humpty Dumpty discharged with yellow stains
on clothing. Balbus bound over not to break the
pieces.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3>SIMPLE SIMON</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">The</span> Pieman makes the pies. Ingredients carefully
concealed. The Pieman’s crest: Bacillus Botulorum
rampantibus.</p>

<p>2 S. Simon starts off for his unwilling walk, and
meets Pieman. His mouth waters. He is penniless.
His eyes water. He is hankeyless. His nose waters.</p>

<p>3 He accosts the Pieman, who respectfully asks to
be allowed a private view of the colour of his money.
No money forthcomes.</p>

<p>4 A passing policeman arrests S. Simon for attempting
to obtain goods under false pretences.</p>

<p>5 The case is heard. Pies produced. Pies heard.
Magistrate orders Court to be cleared and sterilized.</p>

<p>6 Adjourned sitting. Simple Simon is proved to
be an undischarged bankrupt. Discharged accordingly.
Pieman bound over to keep the pies. He pleads for
mercy.</p>

<p>7 The Pieman’s nightmare. Procession of dogs,
cats, horses, and rats, headed by the Pied Piper.
The Pieman’s coat-of-arms: On a field sanguinary
semée de Melton Mowbray proper, a microbe vert,
armed cap-à-pie.</p>


<h3>SEE-SAW, MARGERY DAW</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">Miss Margery Daw’s</span> home in Thibet. Her
boudoir. With inimitable nonchalance she lights a
cigarette. She turns pale. She dies. She disappears
from history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>2 Interior of See-saw factory in Honolulu. Visitor
sees see-saws. He sees saws. He sees saucy girls.
He sees sore hands. A class is being instructed on the
distribution of weight. He waits and sees.</p>

<p>3 Jenny at work with the weight and see-saw. The
foreman arrives and recriminates. Jenny responds in
kind, unkindly. Foreman retires hurt.</p>

</div>

<p>4 Slave market at Jamaica. Jenny on sale, labelled
“Slow.” Wealthy Turk is successfully sold, and buys
her, being partial to sloe jin. Together they execute a
Turkish trot. (Inset, a Turkish execution.)</p>

<p>5 Jenny in her new master’s harem. (Censored.)</p>

<p>6 Jennina out walking, clothed in voluminous
tarboosh. Her glad eye. She is faster than was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
thought. Her master catches her eye, intended for
a Young Turk, and throws it back.</p>

<p>7 Night. Darkness. Exterior of Harem. A sack
descends, falling into river with long, dull, lingering
splash.</p>


<h3>DING DONG BELL</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">A large</span> bell rings itself. Grandsire Triples. Its
grandsire doubles.</p>

<p>2 A well is dug. Well, well!</p>

<p>3 J. Green, a very small boy, throws a dead cat into
the well. It bobs.</p>

<p>4 T. Stout, another very small boy, sits fishing on
the edge of the well. After some hours he pulls out
aforesaid cat. Cat goes (or should go) into the hunt.</p>

<p>5 The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals invokes the majesty of the law (which is
a hass), and attempts to crush J. Green, ætat 7. (Inset,
Johnny’s sister feeding Johnny’s chicken.)</p>

<p>6 The Royal Humane Society awards Medal and
Certificate to T. Stout, who is much moved. (Inset,
Tommy’s mother getting Tommy’s tea.)</p>

<p>7 The galled jade winces, and the large bell is
unrung in Stedman Triples instead.</p>

<p>5 The Jury disagree. They return to Court and
ask Judge if plaintiff may be directed to raise her
veil. (Sensation in Court.) She does so. Judge
faints. Jury retire hastily.</p>

<p>6 Verdict unanimously for defendant, with a rider
to the effect that he has had a lucky escape. Plaintiff
fined 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for malicious persecution, and recommended
to have mercy on all men by keeping visor
lowered.</p>

<h3>DOCTOR FOSTER</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">Mountain scenery</span> in Gloucestershire. Rain falls.
Curtain falls.</p>

<p>2 Foster, the medical student, in his laboratory,
cultivating bacteria, surrounded by stills, alembics,
crucibles, etc. His retorts uncourteous when bitten
by tame streptococcus. (Inset, his pet blue-eyed
staphylococcus begging for gelatine.)</p>

Foster seizes the staff, which forthwith blossoms. He

skill. He produces pocket-knife and amputates Serjeant-Major’s
leg. He amputates both his own arms.
He is accepted, and gazetted Major-General.</p>

<p>5 Proceeding to Gloucester in charge of Ambulance
Column, he is caught in above-mentioned rain. He
steps out of his Daimler into a puddle. He sinks to
the waist. He is hauled out with improvised crane.
He resolves not to revisit Gloucester.</p>

<p>6 Being quite armless, he is allowed to indict
District Council for illegal detention.</p>

<p>7 Judge remarks that “he who comes into Equity
must come with clean hands.” As General Foster has
no hands, and as they would be dirty if he had, case
is dismissed, and he is struck off the Rolls-Royce.</p>

<h3>THE MAN IN THE MOON</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">Tycho Brahe</span> in his observatory. His telescope
(by Dollond) brings the Moon so close that the Man
therefrom slides down the barrel. Tycho is astonied
some.</p>

<p>2 The checking of chronometers—(Inset, the Pagoda
at Kew)—shows that the visitor, travelling by summer
time, has arrived too early. He asks for Ordnance
map of Norfolk. T. Brahe replies “Sur-vey victis.”</p>

<p>3 The Man from Moon journeys southwards. He
arrives at Pampeluna, his cousin. He is hospitably
entertained with pease porridge.</p>

<p>4 Porridge being made from O T meal, he burns his
mouth. He does the obvious, remarking that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fools would have kept it in. The gentility of his
bringing up is questioned. Sic transit.</p>

<p>5 He is called to the Bar. He orders a split soda.
His cousin runs out. He is run in, for treatment which
is not of the nature and quality demanded. One
pussyfoot makes one rude.</p>

<p>6 Ascending in a paravane, he is assumed, as a
balloonatic, to be incapable of managing his affairs,
with costs on the High Court Scale, and the custody
of the weights thereunto belonging. The Man in the
Moon is deceitful upon the weights. He is altogether
lighter than alimony.</p>

<h3>TOM, TOM, THE PIPER’S SON</h3>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">A Peaceful</span> farmyard in Macedonia. A herd of
swine is collecting pearls in silk purses. Swine are
more precious in the Balkans than good women.</p>

<p>2 Thomas, the Greek, arrives. He is not a Jew.
He despises jewellery and loves pork. He steals a
pig. (Inset, the squeal thereof.)</p>

<p>3 Thomas retires to a shady nook and consumes
the pig. He regrets it. So does the pig. Crackling
is heard.</p>

<p>4 Tom’s father, with his pipe. Pipe goes out.
Father goes in. (This is a striking scene.)</p>

Fiddling Saloon. Queen Cole’s allotment. (Inset, a
few vegetables grown by the Princess Anthracite.)</p>

<p>2 The King calls for his pipe. No reply. Boy in
street is heard calling “Paiper.” Exit the King to
buy one.</p>

<p>3 The King calls for his bowl. No reply. He takes
from adjacent peg his bowler, which he dons.</p>

<p>4 The King calls for his three fiddlers. No reply.
Eventually enter three fiddles with low bows. The
King picks one up, and begins to play. Many dogs
come about him, and sit around howling.</p>

<p>5 A crowd arrives, kneeling, and praying him to
desist. Not having a crown on, the King borrows
half-a-crown from each member of the congregation.
This is apt to confound a fellow kneeling, so they rise.</p>

<p>6 The King thus assisting them to rise is hailed as
King Borwick I., afterwards altered, on better
acquaintance, to King Borrowit.</p>

<p>7 Having the fiddlers hanged on lamp-posts leads
to misprision of trees on the green. But the King can
do no wrong. He goes to write, and is left alone.</p>

available ornament in bedroom, Bones, Marrow, 1.
This I hurl at his head, and make tracks.</p>

<p>5 Applying at Police Station for protection against
Taffy’s murderous intentions, I am examined as to
causes precedent. It is suggested that legs of beef
are unusual joints to purchase at 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a week.
Dislike the suggestion, and propose to walk out in
dudgeon.</p>

<p>6 Dudgeon aforesaid discounted by slipping on
banana-skin. Uncontrollable Food Controller accuses
me of hoarding food. I refer him to Taffy, but he

<h2>SPECIMENS OF KINEMATIC
PEDAGOGY</h2>

<h3>LANGUAGES</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">French</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A garden.</span> My aunt. She meets the gardener, who
introduces his aunt to her. My mother and father
arrive with the gardener’s mother and father. They
mutually interrogate regarding the localization of a
missing pen. They divide up into search parties,
chanting “Where is the pen of the gardener’s aunt?”
Alas! if only there were an answer, it would lead to
the next question, “Where is my Chardenal?”</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Latin</span></h4>

<p>Enter Mr. Pickford (not Mary’s father), bearing a
large table in six cases. The consignee removes all
the cases, and the table is declined. A Lord walks
across the screen. He looks like a War Lord. He is
declined. A Boy and a Master come in. The boy
deprives the Master of his e’es. They go out together
botanizing, and find consonant stems; and here endeth
the lesson.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Italian</span></h4>

<p>Un leone and Una. Una feels il. The doctor asks
what is the matter. Uno, she says, and takes Eno.
She gets lo, but pluralizes with gli. So do i. Enter
Dante dreaming of Rossetti. He meets Beatrice
(when on Holliday) and thinks it a divine comedy,
till he finds she doesn’t cary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">German</span></h4>

<p>A dachshund across the screen walked has. A
butcher him met has. He a sausage becomes, and the
customers the rine watch. C’est magnifique, mais ce
n’est pas lager.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Greek</span></h4>

<p>Delos, Samos, and the Wooden one, disputing as to
Homer’s birthplace. The Swan of Avon (follow me,
Leda!) claims to have laid two eggs which produced
the Dove of Peace and a Homer pigeon. Pi. Eta.
Internal irregularities. The middle voice. The temporal
augment, 100 per cent., or the perfect reduplication.
Mu. Kata. On the tiles. The Attic dialect, heard
when alpha beta. O Phi.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hebrew</span></h4>

<p>Aleph ben Jonson enters very very softly. He is
of no value as a vocalist. His bosom friend, Ayin,
makes the sound of a subdued and home-sick calf.
Together they irregularize many verbs, and play havoc
with vowels. They juggle with pronominal suffixes,
but, being true Israelites without guile, they make
something out of it. Their children play in the
talmud and chew targum.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Arabic</span></h4>

<p>The screen is far to sheik, and the auditorium becomes
a desert. The pianist plays “The camels are coming,”
and Mahmoud el Ibrahim, who has been badly jehad,
is placed as an alko ran. Arrival of Kismet at Mecca.
The magic Carpet. The Bashaw of ten tails. The
cat of nine ditto. Gum Arabic. Chewing ditto.
Shaking the spearmint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Shorthand</span></h4>

<p>A pitman duploying to the left in fours. He
encounters a grammalogue, from which, after a bloody
struggle, he removes the vowels. He takes the third
place, and crosses the line. He continues to march
forward with sinuous curves, making a sharp angle
round Amen corner.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chinese</span></h4>

<p>Confucius at home. He invents pictureless Kinematographs
and featureless films. He calls on Ming,
who has but Wun Lung. Go Hang, says Ming. This
causes confucion. So he returns to Ping Pong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Russian</span></h4>


<p>Vodka, disguised as a Bolshevik, is in love with
Popoffski. In Siberia they hunt the wily samovar.
They find a Russian toffee mine, and thereout suck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they no small advantage. They come to Pskoff, but
remain at Prague; and live happily until Vodka climbs
up the Lenin Poland falls off.</p>

<div class="caption">“<i>They hunt the wily samovar.</i>”</div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Assyrian</span></h4>

<p>Sennacherib folded up like a wolf. He unfolds,
and his cuneiform is seen to be that of a man-headed
lion. His pal Assurbani meets him in his chariot,
arrow drawn to head. They conjugate the permansive
of Ittanafal, and recite the numerals as far as ninety-nineveh.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Spanish</span></h4>

<p>Onions. Chestnuts. Sancho Panza and his servantes.
A Don approaches on a mule, slowly. Sancho sizes
him up as a keen sahib, and enquires “Quien sabe?”
They play matador, pompadour, and toreador. The
dago is then shown another door, and a bull-fight
ensues. When will the day go?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hindustani</span></h4>

<p>The plains, with hilly tails. Jubbul, pore fellow,
attends the Delhi Durbar in Sanskrit character, but
finds it difficult to keep his place. As his character
must change with his position, he is hard put to it.
Slinging the bat. Pawning the rooty. The Towers
of Silence. Bukhing up to pass the Parsees. Pas par
ici à Paris. Suttee. Sikh itur ad astrachan. Nepaul
plus ultramarine.</p>

<h2>WELMANISM</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> found it. A vast, colossal, even terrifying
discovery, is mine.</p>

<p>Descendant of a hundred Earls; more mutton-headed
than the sheep which daily entangle themselves
in my motor; with no hope (save the Telephone
service); I now see Empires at my feet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">I Nearly Missed It</span></h3>

<p>For four years, with trembling hands have I opened
my paper—only to dash it with fury into the grate as
my eyes caught the hated word. I changed my paper
until I had to change my stationer.</p>

<p>One day I bought the Parish Magazine of St. Sous
Without. Could it be possible? My lips were dry,
so that I could not turn the pages. I sucked an
acidulated drop. Like a Bank clerk counting Bradburys
and Fishers, or like the autumn, I turned the
leaves, and scanned them with a feverish zeal. It was
not there!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Renaissance</span></h3>

<p>In a moment my mind was made up. My hand
went to my breast-pocket—my Bank book (also made
up). I wrote a postcard, sent a telegram, a special
messenger, Carter Paterson, and went myself in a
cab. As I entered the vast Institute I threw into the
area the bottle of medicine I had that morning purchased
for this effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Home of Efficiency</span></h3>

<p>I was flung into a lift; whirled aloft; flung out. I
rose from my hands and knees, and found myself in
the presence of a small boy wearing the ribbons of
every known and unknown order. “Sign please,” he
demanded. I found my cheque-book open on the
desk. I signed. I saved myself by catching the
basement landing. Five men followed bearing literature.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A New World</span></h3>

<p>I opened the first pamphlet. My head swelled
immediately. Development had begun to commence
starting already. I wrote a letter to the <i>Daily Whale</i>.
It was not published. I knew myself upon the path
to greatness. My horizon was enlarged.</p>

<p>I discarded my glasses and led from a singleton.
While shaving I invented a lock for motor-cars and a
solution of the Irish Problem; I unravelled the Russian
tangle and elaborated a new Tango; I designed a rat-proof
barn and went to breakfast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Amongst my Fellows</span></h3>

<p>An enormous crowd at the Tube Station. I read
one sentence from Pamphlet 2, and I was seated in
the train; another sentence and the train started.</p>

<p>I called at the Bank of England, and informed a
very gentlemanly young fellow that my income would
soon be £5,000 a year by the Welmanometer. He was
superficially interested, and I was conducted to the
vaults. I was presented with a spade. I have not
known an idle moment since.</p>

<p>2 He buys a revolver, and shoots the salesman. As
he goes home he shoots two policemen and an apple
woman. Too easy. He exchanges the revolver for
Winchester Repeating Rifle.</p>

<p>3 He hires an aeroplane to circle above his house.
As people watch it, from his bedroom window he picks
off twenty-three. He tires. He purchases two pennyworth
of rat-poison.</p>

<p>4 He visits the Kitchen of a large Hotel, and very
unostentatiously drops the poison in the soup. 137
deaths due to misadventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>5 He sets fire to the Grand Theatre. 5,022 persons
burned to death alive. On his way home, carrying a
cubic foot of dynamite, he is arrested. (Sensation.)</p>

<p>6 He drops the parcel and escapes. He is tracked.
He is sighted. (More sensation.) He eludes pursuit,
and is never recaptured. He lives happily ever after,
and still retains a warm spot in his heart for the lady
who helped to teach him how to live.</p>

It is returned to drawer for re-check. While books
are in the drawer they cannot be kept. When they
are posted they cannot be retained. Therefore Book-keeping
is impossible.</p>

<p>2 A client arrives. White puts away the trombone,
tells his client what he has come for, and the name
of the person who committed the burglary with
violence. The client agrees, noting subconsciously
that White has a habit of flapping his left ear when
thinking deeply.</p>

<p>3 White takes the case. It is a case of whiskey,
which the client has thoughtfully provided. He turns
up a file of the Quiver, and reads through the Postal
Guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>4 He finds what he wants. He calls Ermyntrude
and starts off. He takes a taxicab to Waterloo, and
goes by train to Richmond.</p>

<p>5 He returns to Hammersmith, takes a motor-bus
to Barnes, and train back to Waterloo. Having thus
thrown off his pursuers, he walks to Vauxhall, followed
by Ermyntrude.</p>

<p>6 He secures assistance from local police and fire
brigade, and between them they arrest the supposititious
criminal—a blind paralytic.</p>

<p>7 White is rewarded with the Freedom of Tooting
Bee and a complimentary dinner at The Stag, Kennington.
Responding to the toast of “Our Greatest
Detective,” he returns the compliment by Tooting
on the trombone. He remains under the table,
flapping his left ear, while Ermyntrude sleeps coiled
up in the instrument.</p>

wings of a dove,” and Peter is prodded with a marlin-spike
till he flies.</p>

<p>3 <span class="smcap">Weighing the Lead.</span> The cook brings his scales
on to the bridge. The sailors swing the lead in turn,
endeavouring to lodge it on the scales. Only the
oldest sailors can do it properly, as it requires much
knack. When it settles on the scales it is weighed by a
waiter.</p>

<p>4 <span class="smcap">Splicing the Mainbrace.</span> (This is one of the pair
worn by the Captain, and often bursts under the strain
of responsibility.) The two ends are unravelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
adjusted, twisted, intertwined, and finally wrapped
round and round with sailors’ yarn. Very telling.</p>

<p>5 <span class="smcap">Shivering the Timbers.</span> The carpenters parade
with adzes and belaying pins. The timber is pinned to
the running blocks. Carpenters remove their hose.
Cold water is turned on to the timber from the hose.
If the temperature is too high, it is almost impossible
to make the timbers shiver.</p>

<h2>THE TOPICAL BUDGET<br />
<br />
<small>LIFE IN THE ARMY. <span class="smcap">By a Sailor</span></small></h2>


<p>1 <span class="smcap">Physical Jerks.</span> The Doctor in his dispensary.
The Army enters one by one. Each man is recorded
as A1, then examined with an empty stethoscope
without lenses. He is told he has a tendency to
appendicitis, and is given a bottle of N.Y.D. As he
leaves the room he jerks the physic through the porthole.
Hence the name.</p>

<p>2 <span class="smcap">Chewing the Rag.</span> (All soldiers do it.) Rags
of various kinds. The Serjeant-major’s. The A.S.C.
(more usual). The rag before chewing. It looks
<i>something</i> like a ration. Group of old sweats chewing
the same. Enter Orderly Officer: “Any complaints?”
He vanishes. Chewing is resumed, but
the rag is never consumed.</p>

<p>3 <span class="smcap">Duck-shoving.</span> (Pastime invented by Drake.)
A pair of white ducks is tethered to the last post.
Each soldier has a drum, which he tries to beat with a
duck’s drumstick. As soon as one soldier seizes a
duck, another soldier pushes the duck away. The
game is played with great fierceness, and causes much
amusement, especially to the ducks.</p>

<p>4 <span class="smcap">Drawing Rations.</span> A huge pair of ration pinchers
advances on the Purser. A tin of bully is extracted,
sounding like a gramophone. An officer intervenes
with the remark: “You can’t have that; this is a
pickle day.” He whistles. The tin returns to store.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
A case of rum is pinched. The officer smiles. He
knows it is lime-juice.</p>

<p>5 <span class="smcap">Square-pushing.</span> This sport requires much
secrecy, and no soldier will tell you how <i>he</i> does it.
The youngest recruit is sent for the key of the square.
The older soldiers don special boots for the function.
Mounted services wear special spurs, whose rowels
sound like an harp. The order is then given, “On
the hands, down,” and the square is pushed. The older
birds slope off.</p>

<h2>THRILLING ADVENTURES ROUND
THE NORTH POLE</h2>


<p>1 <span class="smcap">The</span> expedition starts. Josie. Frank Ashburningham.
The mascot (a giraffe). The ship sails
from Stoke Newington. Portions of the crowd which
sees them off.</p>

<p>2 Passing the Hebrides. Off Plymouth Sound.
The Mountains of Maughan. Sunrise on Popocatapetl.
Icebergs off Bombay. Moonlight effects on Streatham
Common. Mascot dies of tonsilitis.</p>

<p>3 First glimpses of unknown land. Closer acquaintance
proves it to be Greenland. Josie maintains it is
Iceland. The thermometer falls lower than the mercury,
which therefore boils under atmospheric pressure.
Mascot dies of beri-beri.</p>

<p>4 Crossing the ice. (Note the tracks of Josie’s
high heels.) A barrier. It is removed. A snow-drift.
It is removed. Mascot dies of trench feet. Warm
clothing a necessity. Good old Thermos.</p>

<p>5 More ice. The aneroid measures only 1,437 miles
from the Pole. Forward! Mascot dies of misfeasance.
Josie has a touch of sunstroke. They proceed under
great difficulties.</p>

<p>6 The rigour of the North. Nearing the Pole.
Cutting it short. Four miles further. Mascot dies of
aniline. Waiting for day-break. The start of the last
lap. Sighting the Pole.</p>

<p>7 Arrival at the Pole. The Scotsman comes to
greet them, and asks for a pinch of snuff. Mascot dies
of erudition. The return to Blighty.</p>

<h2>KINEMATIC MATHEMATICS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arithmetic</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Decimals</span> seated round the Multiplication Table.
They perform evolutions and involutions, till one is
transformed by a duodenary ulcer. An escape of
gas. They find the scenty meter, and measure it
with a rule of three feet. They practice. They share
stocks out of all proportion. Enter a herring and
a half, which they decide to Pendle bury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Music</span></h3>

<p>Dramatis Personæ: Major C.; a miner; and a
common cord. The dominant personality of the Major
resolves the miner into such a dire state that he needs
a dire tonic. In less than a diminished second his
whole tone is raised. (Double sharp work, what?)
He takes a breve rest, quavering with a minimum of
divergent emotion in the effort to be natural. <i>Eheu
fugue asses!</i> They nearly forte, but the discord was
inverted by the Major’s apologiatura, which was as
handsomely chromatic as his socks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Algebra</span></h3>

<p>Enter a fraction. (Censored, as too vulgar.) Problem
plays and multinomial theorems are added to and subtracted
from him, when a quadratic (half mulatto,
half white) arrives, and removes his brackets. This
reduces him to tears and lowest terms, and he is
rapidly factorized. Treating the absurd with sum series-ness,
he regains his expansion, permuting his functions
to accord with the senary. The equation, like justice,
is satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Building</span></h3>

<p>The bricklayer enters an inn and pays his footing
with a Flemish Bond. He takes a header through the
window, and is carried off on a stretcher, being unable
to keep the perpends. The template filled with trench
mortar. The bricklayer on the scaffold. His last
moments. He falls into a putlog hole. Tying knots
in a tiebeam. The falling eaves. Eaves dropping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Geometry</span></h3>

<p>1 (Euclid I. 5.) Scene, an Isosceles triangle. Enter
the two angles at the base. They build a bridge of
asses. (This is unnecessary, but usual.) They have a
tug-of-war. Neither can move the other. Therefore
they are equal.</p>

<p>2 (Euclid I. 20.) Scene, a Triangle. Enter the
three sides. Two of these are carrying a large grater.
They are therefore greater than the other side.</p>

<p>3 (Euclid I. 46.) Enter a Policeman, model of
rectitude, representing a given straight line. His
hollowed rearward hand receives a coin. He is
squared.</p>

<p>4 (Euclid I. 47.) Scene, a right-angled Triangle.
Enter A.B., an hypotenuse. He makes his claim.
Enter two other sides, Jachin and Boaz. They square
up. A.B. knocks both down, proving that he is equal
to both of them together.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></h2>

<p>The object of this book is to show the educational
possibilities of the Kinematograph, as applied to
almost any subject. It does not pretend to exhaustiveness,
though it will be found somewhat exhausting.
Several examples are given of the way in which pedagogic
methods should be used, though many matters
have been left severely alone.</p>

<p>Before a child walks unaided, he runs. Before he
runs he crawls. Let him therefore crawl through his
Kinematic Alphabet (omitted from this book) before
proceeding to the abstruser Kinematic Nursery Rhymes
(which will give him a good groundwork in Kinematic
Law). Thence he will skim through Kinematic
Languages, Kinematic Mathematics, and certain Kinematic
Sciences; and so on to Kinematic Art, Kinematic
Politics, and Kinematic Medicine (which form the
subject of a separate work).<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<h2>RINGING THE CHANGES</h2>


<p>1 <span class="smcap">Buncle</span> spends a week-end in Mexico. He joins a
Revolution. He wins. As a reward he is shown the
ancient Aztec Temples. He enters the Cortes, and is
initiated into the Mysteries. Poking the hontas.
Mounting the Zuma.</p>

<p>2 An old priestess tells him a secret. He retires
with a ruddy blush. An old priest gives him a phial,
explaining that it contains the Liquor of Creation,
enabling the owner to create what he wills. The yarn
licks creation.</p>

<p>3 At Brighton Station. A crowd. No seats. Buncle
creates an armchair. Seats himself. Angry exclamations.
Porter politely requests him to move. He
refuses. More politeness. Inspector fetched. Indicates
distinction between heavy goods traffic and
passengers’ luggage. Buncle rises. As porter embraces
chair, Buncle changes it into a bag of soot. The train
arrives.</p>

<p>4 Buncle seats himself in train, and creates an outsize
Newfoundland dog. Inspector objects. Tries to
seize dog, which becomes a toy Pomeranian. Inspector
grasps air. He sees the Pom, and grabs. Pom becomes
hedgehog. Inspector utters cursory remarks and
returns to platform. While he examines his hands,
hedgehog becomes giraffe, which affectionately licks
his ear.</p>

staff, who proceed to drive giraffe away. It becomes an
old woman of garrulous type, who prettily thanks them
for their courtesy, but appeals to police for protection.
As friendly constable shepherds her through crowd,
she incontinently becomes a steam-roller. The crowd
dissipates, while the steam-roller calmly changes to a
child’s perambulator. As the officials approach, this
becomes an aeroplane, which rises with soft purring as
train bears Buncle away to Preston Park.</p>

<h2>THE KINEMATIC GOLF<br />
CHAMPIONSHIP</h2>


<p>1 <span class="smcap">Brade</span> climbing holly-tree to recover lost club.
Secretary demurs. It is pointed out that this is
exhibition play. Something tears. Exhibition expected.
It is only braid. Tailor summoned hastily.</p>

<p>2 Fardon’s drive. Fardon the ages now. Its
journey well begun. It strikes a toompty. Then rolls
on. He holes a five in one.</p>

<p>3 Teeing off the caddy. A spoon shot. A pull.
Very hot. A dead stymie. Poor little thing! Humanity
prevails. Military honours. Dormy one.</p>

<p>4 Brade haz ’ard luck in a hazard. He digs.
“Having no spade, partner?” Bunker replaced by
onlookers. Several onlookers replaced in bunker.</p>

<p>5 Casual water. Pulling Fardon out of a well
without penalty. One up and the deuce to pay. Brade
plays puff-ball in mistake for golf-ball. Bystanders
appreciably thinning. Overtaking a foursome. A
threesome. Loathesome.</p>

<p>6 The end of the game. Part of the ritual of golf.
Panorama of moving figures running off for gin and
ginger. The Sunningdale Arms. Arm in arm. Links.
Unlinked. “Not stopping this side of Virginia Water.”</p>

<h2>THREE PROBLEM PLAYS</h2>


<h3>I.—SHOULD SHE HAVE WORN THEM?</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Gertrude</span> seated at breakfast table. Eggs,
ham, bacon, kidneys, kippers, etc. Lady Gertrude
helps herself to all except the last.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony enters late. She glares at him while
he seats himself. Butler offers him everything in
turn, but each dish is waved away by Lady Gertrude.
At last he seizes a kipper on his fork. He takes one
bite. It is snatched away by Lady Gertrude and
thrown at the cat. He takes a piece of toast, but is
unable to secure margarine or marmalade. He breakfasts.</p>

<p>At the front door. Sir Anthony stands waiting.
Hunting garb complete, except that he wears black
trousers instead of white breeches. A friend arrives
on horseback, and indicates, “Coming to the meet in
those?” Sir Anthony jerks thumb in direction of
Lady Gertrude, and points to his trousers.</p>

<h3>II.—SHOULD THEY HAVE GONE?</h3>

<p>Angelina elopes with Edwin. Angelina’s father
pursues them, but fails to overtake them until they
are married. Angelina’s mother arrives and bursts
into tears. A snowstorm. No conveyance available
except tandem bicycle with sidecar and trailer. Edwin
has hired this, and proposes to start directly after
lunch. Angelina’s father and mother implore. Edwin
declines. Angelina is neutral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding, however, that trailer is certain to get
unfastened by vibration, and that no one can possibly
remain seated in sidecar, Edwin agrees to take
passengers. They start. Trailer slips off backwards
down long hill. Sidecar falls over precipice.</p>

<p>Edwin and Angelina reach their destination, but
find that old birds are missing. Angelina suggests
half-heartedly that Edwin should go back and search.
Edwin declines. They enter hotel, and live happily
ever afterwards.</p>

<h3>III.—WAS THE PRICE TOO HIGH?</h3>

<p>Percy, the millionaire’s son and heir. He falls in
love with Rebecca, daughter of a multi-millionaire.
Percy’s father had once been in love with Rebecca’s
mother. Percy’s mother had several times been in
love with Rebecca’s father. Nobody knew this except
the Press.</p>

<p>Percy tells his father of his love-affair. Father is
furious. He sends for his lawyer, his will, his banker,
and his tobacconist. He tells Percy that if he marries
Rebecca, all his money shall go to the Home for
Diseased and Incurable Kimonos. Percy asks to be
allowed to think it over.</p>

<p>Percy tells Rebecca. Her father declares that when
she marries Percy he will give him as a wedding present
twenty million dollars. Percy thinks it over. He goes to
his father. He makes the grand refusal. “Father, I
love her. I will pay your price.” His father accordingly
alters his will.</p>

<h2>TALES OF TRAVELLERS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ananias</span> and Sapphira Munchausen plotting to
become great explorers. Ananias determines to discover
the North Pole. Sapphira insists on finding the
South Seas. They finally decide to fit out two expeditions,
and to communicate by wireless telephony.</p>

<p>Ananias buys his outfit. He is thin, but when
clothed, entire staff cannot get him through doorway.
Sleighs. Icepicks. Toothpicks. Thermos flasks.
Electric radiators. “Label everything Munchausen,
and send to my hotel.” Ten pantechnicons convey
the goods to hotel.</p>

<p>Sapphira buys her outfit. Five hundred sh! A
thousand you know whats. Other garments in proportion.
She is much thinner when garbed for her
expedition, but chases shop-walker for suggesting a
dripping-pan. Ice-cream machines. Hammocks.
Palanquins. Canoes. “Label everything Munchausen,
and send to my hotel.” Twenty-seven pantechnicons
convey the goods to hotel.</p>

<p>Street blocked. Hotel refuses to accept delivery.
The Munchausens arrive. Goods dumped in doorway.
People in hotel cannot get out. Mountaineering
parties arranged. One party falls in road, and is run
over by traction engine. Other parties entangled in
ropes of yet other parties. Lucky blow of ice-pick
catches Sapphira in rear.</p>

<p>The start. One small boy on otherwise deserted
quay listens to speeches from the two different boats.</p>

<p>Beautiful scenery near North Pole. Ananias unpacks.
Large quantities of ladies’ light summer
clothing. Puts all on, in a rage, and appears on deck.
Captain puts him in irons.</p>

<p>Beautiful scenery in South Seas. Sapphira unpacks.
Large quantities of Arctic garments. Puts them on,
raging, and cannot turn round in cabin. Is hauled on
deck by steam crane through skylight. Captain puts
her in irons.</p>

<p>Both explorers suddenly remember wireless telephone.
Air fuses all along the line. Both ships catch
fire. Arrival at port. Boats meeting. Ananias finds
affinity and tells the tale. Sapphira finds affinity and
tells the tale.</p>

<p>As the boats pass they see one another. Sapphira
falls on her affinity’s neck. Breaks it. With one
scornful glance she throws herself into the sea, swamping
a liner with the wash.</p>

<p>Ananias cries out in astonishment, “My wife!”
He is thereupon knocked overboard by his affinity.
He is washed on to a high cliff by his wife’s wash.
Sapphira tries to follow. Causes a landslide. They
roll in each other’s arms to the beach. The boats
steam away, while passengers throw everything portable
at them and fire at them with syphons and signal guns.
Both are left lying.</p>

<h2>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</h2>


<p>“Good.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“An excellent book for serious thinkers ... showing
a thorough grasp of every subject it deals with. What
especially pleases us is the absence of all attempt at
humour.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“Should go far .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as far as possible.”—<i>Church
Times.</i></p>

<p>“The Areopagitica filled a lacuna in English literature
which had not previously been noticed. Milton
in his blindness saw what others, better equipped with
visual organs, had failed to perceive. What was his
reward? Is not his monumental work the text-book
for all encyclopædists of the Areopagus?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
it is a trifle heavy. Even Q. H. Flaccus opined that it
was dulce to desipere in loco. Sometimes one feels
the need of a lighter work, which makes a less severe
tax on the cerebellular tissue. This is it.”—<i>Daily
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“Rotten.”—G. S. B. in <i>Extenso</i>.</p>

<p>“Teachers will welcome this volume, as it proves
clearly how superfluous is the didactician.”—<i>Schoolmaster.</i></p>

<p>“These scribblers just have got it in once. It eats.
They are some shakes.”—<i>American Review.</i></p>

<div class='cast'>AFTER THIS YOU WILL WANT</div>

<div class='cast'>SOMETHING TO TAKE</div>

<div class='unindent'>a common or garden Nursery Rhyme and a rare or

<div class='unindent'>to make such a comparison, although it sounds something
